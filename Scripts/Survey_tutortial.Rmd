# Survey Tutorial Project

1. Your job is to design an annual trawl survey for Dusky Scallop Shark (*Dustious maximus*; Figure \@ref(fig:nafo-plt)). The survey occurs June when the stock is spawning.
2. The stock area shown has been chosen as a compromise between the stock biology, stakeholder input, and operational constraints (Figure \@ref(fig:base-plt)(.
3. In planning your survey there are 2 variables you can control
    a. You can vary the number of survey tows
        - From start to finish it takes approximately 3 hours to complete a tow and finish the scientific analyses
        - The vessel is available for the entire month of June
    b. You can decide if you want to have a random or stratified survey 
        - There are 2 options for stratification 
          - NAFO sub-areas (Figure \@ref(fig:nafo-plt))
          - Depth strata (Figure \@ref(fig:depth-plt))
        - Note that the tows will be allocated proportionally to the area of each stratum.
4. You can also 'simulate' different biomass distributions to see if this changes your opinion on either the stratification scheme or the number of stations you need.
    a. The "Random" option distributes the biomass using a 'random field' 
        - There is a spatial pattern to the data but the pattern is randomly generated
    b. The "NAFO" option has an underlying 'random field' which sets the pattern for each simulation
        - Then this field is augmented depending on which NAFO strata you are in
        - The biomass in the central area is elevated
        - The biomass in the nearshore and offshore areas are lowered
    c. The "Depth" option also has an underlying 'random field' which sets the pattern for each simulation
        - Then this field is augmented by each Depth strata
        - The biomass in deeper waters are lowered
        
# Topics to Consider

1. How does increasing the number of tows influence the accuracy and the precision of the results?
    - Consider the trade-offs between the number of tows and accuracy and precision of the survey results with logistical constraints of running a survey

2. When you have few survey stations (e.g. ≈20) why are the stratified survey biomass estimates generally biased? 
    - *Hint* Look at the NAFO stratification (Figure \@ref(fig:nafo-samp-plt))

2. Consider Figure \@ref(fig:base-plt) and discuss how biological, social, economic, or political factors could influence the design of the survey of the (*D. maximus*) stock (population) in this Region.
  - *Hints*: 
    - Biological versus artificial boundaries
    - Canada versus United States
    - Survey occurs during spawning

3. Consider Figures \@ref(fig:rand-samp-plt) - \@ref(fig:depth-samp-plt) and Table \@ref(tab:res-table). 
    - Which of the 3 sampling methods (Random, NAFO stratification, Depth stratification) would you suggest to use for the survey and why?
    - Does changing the underlying biomass distribution effect your opinion?
  


<!-- Here are the parameters you should change -->

```{r survey-inputs, echo=F}
# You can set the number of stations...
n.tows <- 20

# This sets up how the biomass is distributed through the region.
bm.dist <- c("Random","NAFO","Depth") 
# Which Biomass distribution do you want [1] will be Random Survey, 2 will be NAFO survey, and 3 will be "Depth
# Just comment and uncomment to shift between the options
#bm.dist <- bm.dist[1] # This is biomass distributed randomly throughout the region
bm.dist <- bm.dist[2] # This makes the biomass distribution be a function of the NAFO strata
#bm.dist <- bm.dist[3] # This makes the biomass distribution being a function of depth

# This changes the number of simulations you run, I suggest trying 1, 4, and 250 (250 will be slow!) to see if it changes your opinion
n.sims <- 9

```


<!-- These parameters could also be changed if you'd like to do additional exploration, but isn't part of the core assignment here -->


```{r other-parameters, echo=F}

# You can change the area that is covered by each survey tow. This value is in m². The default value of 10,000 is equivalent to a 2 km survey tow that is 5 meters wide
# Changing this won't have as much impact as it might in real world as simulation of real world variability in densities would take hours, so we leave it 
# as a fixed number
area.swept <-  10000    # somewhere in the 1000's of square meters tends to make sense here for trawl kinds of gear.  Also need to convert to km²
# This too would have impacts on results if we had a more realistic biomass distribution scenario, but in this world we will leave it as is.
tot.biomass <- 100000 # Could be any units, let's call it tonnes, and because of how I have this set up below this number isn't exact
# Catchability could also be allowed to vary spatially, but that adds a layer of complexity that is beyond the scope of this exercise, so 
# changing this won't really do anything other than rescale the biomass per tow and survey biomass estimates.
catchability <- 0.3 # What proportion of the population does survey tend to catch, going to fix this at 0.3 for simplicity

## Survey Simulation

So now we can review the input data we have for our survey.  First we will look at some figures. First off, lets take a look at our survey area, included in this figure are the North Atlantic Fishery Organization (NAFO) subareas that are the basis for the NAFO stratification, and the bathymetry of the region, which is used as the basis of the depth stratification (Figure \@ref(fig:base-plt)).  


```{r base-plt,echo=F, warning =F, message=F,fig.width=8,fig.height=8, fig.cap="The assessment area for the Dusky Scalloped Shark (*Dustious maximus*) is outlined by the thick grey line. The thin black lines are the NAFO subareas in the region. The red line divides shows the division between the economic exclusive zone (EEZs) for Canada and the United States. The bathymetry in the region is also shown."}

base.plt 

```

```{r nafo-plt,echo=F, warning =F, message=F,fig.width=8,fig.height=8, fig.cap="The NAFO stratification polygons used for stratification."}

nafo.str.plt <- base.domain + geom_sf(data = nafo.strata, size=2,fill=NA) + geom_sf_text(data = nafo.strata,aes(label=id),size=3)

nafo.str.plt

```

```{r depth-plt,echo=F, warning =F, message=F,fig.width=8,fig.height=8, fig.cap="The Depth stratification polygons used for stratification."}

depth.str.plt <- base.domain + geom_sf(data = depth.strata, size=1,aes(fill=strata, color=strata)) + scale_fill_viridis_d(alpha=0.5,option = "C") + scale_fill_viridis_d(alpha=0.5,option = "C") 

depth.str.plt

```

Now we can also show the distribution of the biomass in the area.  If `r n.sims` is greater than 1 then we'll show two or three realizations from the models depending on how many simulations we ran. First we show the biomass distribution with the random survey stations overlain (Figure \@ref(fig:rand-samp-plt)). 


```{r rand-samp-plt,echo=F, warning =F, message=F,fig.width=7,fig.height=10, fig.cap="Biomass distribution with the random survey stations overlain"}
# Now make our plot(s)
if(n.sims == 1) p.rand.plt <- p.rand[[1]]  + ggtitle(paste("Simulation 1"))

Next we show the biomass distribution with the NAFO survey stations and NAFO strata overlain (Figure \@ref(fig:rand-samp-plt)).

if(n.sims == 3) p.nafo.plt <-   plot_grid(p.nafo[[1]]+ ggtitle(paste("Simulations 1, 2 and 3")),p.nafo[[2]]+ ggtitle(""),p.nafo[[3]],ncol =2)

p.nafo.plt
```

Finally, we show the biomass distribuiton with the Depth survey stations and Depth stratification overlain (Figure \@ref(fig:depth-samp-plt))

```{r depth-samp-plt,echo=F, warning =F, message=F,fig.width=7,fig.height=10, fig.cap="Biomass distribution with the Depth survey stations overlain and the Depth stratification polygons overlain."}
# Now make our plot(s)
if(n.sims == 1) p.depth.plt <- p.depth[[1]]+ ggtitle(paste("Simulation 1"))
if(n.sims == 2) p.depth.plt <-   plot_grid(p.depth[[1]]+ ggtitle(paste("Simulations 1 and 2")),p.depth[[2]] + ggtitle(""),ncol =1)
if(n.sims == 3) p.depth.plt <-   plot_grid(p.depth[[1]]+ ggtitle(paste("Simulations 1, 2 and 3")),p.depth[[2]]+ ggtitle(""),p.depth[[3]],ncol =2)
if(n.sims > 3)  p.depth.plt <-   plot_grid(p.depth[[1]]+ ggtitle(paste("Simulations 1, 2, 3, and",n.sims)),p.depth[[2]]+ ggtitle(""),p.depth[[3]],p.depth[[4]],ncol =2)
p.depth.plt
```

# Now we can compare the random survey estimates to the depth and NAFO stratified surveys.
